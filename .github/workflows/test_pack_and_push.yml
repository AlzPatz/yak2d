# .NET Core Workflow - Alex Paterson:

# Overview
# ---------
# A ci/cd approach that tests and publishes packages from the MASTER branch
# User controlled Major.Minor.Patch version numbers set in version.json file
# Publishes new official NUGET package on a change to the user defined version number in version.json
# Publishes a development package to MyGet on any push to master (with modified package name and four component version number, fourth component auto generated)
# A development package can be pushed to MyGet from any branch using string sequence in git commit message
# All pushes and pulls upload a package file as an artifact of the github action
# Versioning tool (nerdbank.gitversioning) only used by github action, is not (and should not) be present in project itself
# Therefore, local builds do not stamp version file on assembly 
# (If required, should still be manually possible if <Version> is defined in the .csproj, but this has not been tested to ensure does not interfere with pack paramter override on github action workflow, should be fine_
    
# In slightly more detail...  
#----------------------------
# Job #1 "test" -> Checkout, restore, build and test on all major operating systems (windows, linux, osx)

# Job #2 "packandpush"
# Assumes "test" successful
# Publishes Official Nuget feed RELEASE if MASTER push contains a NEW version number (three integar format 1.2.3) as defined by user in version.json
# Publishes Development DEBUG Package to MyGet feed on ALL pushes to master (version number used four integer format 1.2.3.4) - use development package name to differentiate from official nuget name
# Uses the fact that Nuget.Org will (on skip duplicates) not allow a package with the same version (Major.Minor.Patch) to be uploaded if it exists already (hence official release when user changed Major.Minor.Patch first occurs),
# and that uploads to MyGet will use 4 component version number meaning each commit does have a unique version number (MyGet publish will work each time as not duplicated version number)
# Uploads Package as an artifact on all pushes and pulls
# A Package is also uploaded to the MyGet development feed if the top commit comment for a PUSH on a non-master branch, contains a defined search string ($PUSH_PACK_NON_MASTER_STRING)
# This pacakge uses Major.Minor.Patch + non-release NBGV metadata tag to generate unique version numbers

# Version numbers are generated using nerdbank.gitversioning (NBGV)
# NBGV is NOT included as a package in the projects themselves, it is only installed and used during the github action build
# DO NOT INCLUDE NBGV AS A PACKAGE IN YOUR PROJECTS -  it will override the attempts to define the version numbers for packages later on
# Version numbers and package names are provided as properties to the dotnet pack command (local builds will not have version numbers updated)
# version.json is used to define Major.Minor.Patch first three integers
# The user therefore defines these first three integers and should update them when desired (will trigger Nuget feed publish)
# On a pack from a MASTER pull the four integer NBGV release version number (Major.Minor.Patch.{BuildHeight}, such as 1.2.3.4) is used as package version number
# For any non-Master push/pull or master pull, the SemVer2 NBGV version with included build metadata string is used as the version number, such as 1.2.3-g2321387

# This method allows the usage of NBGV to generate unique version numbers, whilst also allowing the publishes of the same packages to different feeds
# with differing names and versioning numbers, reducing difficulties in switching between consuming the package under nuget and myget
# the artifacts can allow testing of any push or pull without requiring an upload to a feed (useful for critical pull requests)

# Repo assumptions:
# version.json present of format:
# {
#  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning/master/src/NerdBank.GitVersioning/version.schema.json",
#  "version": "1.2.3",    <!-- User defined. Update this version on push to MASTER to trigger new official nuget publish. User Major.Minor.Patch format -->
#  "publicReleaseRefSpec": [
#    "^refs/heads/master$" <!-- workflow assumes that nerdbank.gitversioning will create a release format version number for master, so ensure this is include as the only release branch tag -->
#  ]
# }
# Contains one project that will be target of nuget packaging
# Possible to build and test from defined code root (such as having a top level .sln in ./src/ referencing seperate projects in sub-directories)
